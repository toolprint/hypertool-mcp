## 🎯 Why Hypertool?

**The Problem**: LLMs struggle when overwhelmed with too many tools. 50+ tools from multiple MCP servers? Your AI assistant becomes confused and ineffective.

**The Solution**: Hypertool lets you create focused, dynamic toolsets that expose only the tools you need for specific tasks. Think of it as "tool playlists" for your AI.

**Only one MCP in mcp.json**: Hypertool will read your mcp configuration and run as both a server (to cursor/claude code, etc.) and run or connect to your MCPs regardless of transport.

```
Cursor / Claude Code → Hypertool MCP → Your MCPs
```
```
📦 Multiple MCP Servers → 🎯 Focused Toolsets → 🚀 Better Performance
```

## ✨ Key Features

- **🎯 Dynamic Toolsets**: Create custom tool collections from any MCP servers
- **🔄 Hot-Swapping**: Switch between toolsets instantly - clients are notified automatically using MCP list tools changed notifications.
- **🌐 Universal Compatibility**: Works with any MCP client (Claude Desktop, etc.)
- **🛡️ Tool Checks**: Toolsets capture a hashed tool reference to validate that the right tool gets exposed.
- **📡 Multiple Transports**: Supports both stdio and HTTP/SSE protocols

## 🚀 Quick Start

Install hypertool in all your agentic apps.
```bash
npx -y @toolprint/hypertool-mcp@latest --install

# use the --dry-run flag to see what will be installed.
```

Just restart Cursor/Claude Code and it will pick up hypertool. All your MCP configs get automatically backed up so that you can restore them at any time.

## Add Hypertool to your project

### Claude Code
**Option 1 - quick add**
```bash
# In your project directory:
npx -y @toolprint/hypertool-mcp@latest --install claude-code
```

**Option 2 - manual add**
1. Copy your `.mcp.json` to `.mcp.hypertool.json`
2. Update your `.mcp.json` with only the hypertool MCP:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hypertool": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
          "-y", 
          "@toolprint/hypertool-mcp@latest", 
          "--mcp-config", 
          ".mcp.hypertool.json"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

> **Claude Code Dynamic Toolset Support** - Currently CC doesn't support [MCP tool change notifications](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/tools#tool-discovery-and-updates) (we know, it surprised us too) but we suspect this is coming soon. We've opened an issue [here](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/411). Please give it an upvote if you want this too. 

> In the meantime, just restart your claude code session to pick up your newly equipped toolset OR run your hypertool-mcp with the `--equip-toolset {name}` flag and it will autoequip on boot.

### 🎯 Cursor
**Option 1 - One command install**
```bash
npx -y @toolprint/hypertool-mcp@latest --install cursor
```

This will:
- Back up your current Cursor MCP configuration
- Copy all existing servers to Hypertool's config
- Add Hypertool as your main MCP server

**Option 2**

[![Install Hypertool MCP Server](https://cursor.com/deeplink/mcp-install-light.svg)](https://cursor.com/install-mcp?name=hypertool&config=JTdCJTIydHlwZSUyMiUzQSUyMnN0cmVhbWFibGUtaHR0cCUyMiUyQyUyMmNvbW1hbmQlMjIlM0ElMjJucHglMjAteSUyMCU0MHRvb2xwcmludCUyRmh5cGVydG9vbC1tY3AlMjAtLWNvbmZpZyUyMH4lMkYuY3Vyc29yJTJGbWNwLmpzb24lMjIlN0Q%3D)

Click the badge above to automatically install Hypertool MCP in Cursor IDE. This will add the server to your Cursor configuration and you can start using it immediately.

**Note** you will need to update the runtime flag for the hypertool mcp server `--mcp-config` to point to a copied version of Cursor's MCP settings. All of this is done automatically in **Option 1**.


## Other Projects
1. Copy your `mcp.json` to `.mcp.hypertool.json`
2. Update your `mcp.json` with only the hypertool MCP:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hypertool": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
          "-y", 
          "@toolprint/hypertool-mcp@latest", 
          "--mcp-config", 
          ".mcp.hypertool.json"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```


## 🎭 Creating Your First Toolset

Once Hypertool is running, you can use the built-in MCP tools to manage toolsets:

1. **List available tools**: Use `list-available-tools` to see what's discovered
2. **Build a toolset**: Use `build-toolset` to create a focused collection
3. **Equip the toolset**: Use `equip-toolset` to activate it

Your MCP client (like Claude) can now call these tools directly:

```
Claude: Use the build-toolset tool to create a development toolset with echo and add_numbers
```

**Result**: A focused toolset with only the tools you need!

## 🔄 Hot-Swapping Toolsets Example

Just chat with your assistant to swap toolsets using the `equip-toolset` tool.

Hypertool will equip the tools and send a change notification so that your assistant can read and use the newly executable tools.


## Add Notes to tools!

Sometimes descriptions and reading input parameters isn't enough for an LLM to figure out how to use a tool.

Hypertool gives your agents a `add-tool-annotation` tool that lets them add notes to reflect on better usage the next time so that they don't need to keep spinning in circles in new contexts.

## 🌐 Multiple Transport Support

### Stdio (Default)
Perfect for Claude Desktop and most MCP clients:
```bash
hypertool-mcp --mcp-config {path_to_config}
```

### HTTP/SSE
Have it run separately and listen on a port over HTTP:
```bash
hypertool-mcp --transport http --port 3000 --config test-mcp.json
```

Access via: `http://localhost:3000/mcp`

## 🛡️ Security & Validation

Hypertool validates tool references using cryptographic hashes:

```json
{
  "name": "secure-toolset",
  "tools": [
    {
      "namespacedName": "everything.echo",
      "refId": "sha256:abc123...",
      "server": "everything"
    }
  ]
}
```

- **Secure by default**: Rejects tools with changed schemas
- **Insecure mode**: Available with `--insecure` flag (use carefully!)
- **Automatic validation**: Toolsets are re-validated when servers reconnect

## 📋 Common Workflows

### Development Setup
```
1. Start Hypertool: hypertool-mcp --config test-mcp.json
2. Ask Claude: "Use build-toolset to create a frontend toolset with echo and add_numbers"
3. Ask Claude: "Use equip-toolset to activate the frontend toolset"
```

### Production Debugging
```
1. Ask Claude: "Use equip-toolset to switch to debug toolset"
2. Your AI now has access to focused debugging tools
3. MCP clients are automatically notified of the change
```

### Team Collaboration
```
1. Ask Claude: "Use list-saved-toolsets to see available toolsets"
2. Share toolset configurations via your preferred method
3. Team members can equip the same toolsets for consistency
```

## 🔧 Configuration Reference

- 🎯 Precise tool selection  
- 🚀 Faster, more accurate responses
