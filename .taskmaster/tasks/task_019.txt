# Task ID: 19
# Title: Add Server Health Monitoring
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 15
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement health monitoring system to track underlying server availability with reconnection logic
# Details:
Create health monitor that periodically checks underlying server availability using MCP ping/health check mechanisms. Implement reconnection logic with exponential backoff for failed connections. Track server status (online/offline/error) and update tool availability accordingly. Add health check scheduling and connection recovery procedures. Emit health events for monitoring.

# Test Strategy:
Health check interval tests, reconnection logic tests, server failure simulation tests, health event emission tests
