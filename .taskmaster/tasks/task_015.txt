# Description: Implement connection pool management system to establish and maintain connections to multiple underlying MCP servers [Updated: 7/10/2025]
# Details:
Create connection manager that spawns and maintains connections to underlying MCP servers based on parsed configuration. Implement connection pooling with proper lifecycle management (connect, disconnect, reconnect). Support both stdio and HTTP transport protocols. Handle connection failures with retry logic and connection state tracking. Use TypeScript generics for type-safe connection handling.
