## Why Focused Toolsets Work

The science behind HyperTool's approach is backed by extensive research on LLM tool usage and cognitive load.

## Key Research Papers

### ðŸ“Š Less is More: Optimizing Function Calling for LLM Execution (2024)

**Key Findings:**
- **89% accuracy** with <10 tools vs **32% accuracy** with 50+ tools
- **71% improvement** in task completion rates with focused tool selections
- LLMs struggle with "cognitive overload" when presented with too many options

**What This Means for You**: By limiting your AI to 5-10 tools per context, you're operating in the optimal performance zone identified by researchers.

### ðŸ§  Tool Learning with Large Language Models: A Survey (2024)

**Key Findings:**
- Context window constraints make large tool sets impractical
- Tool selection accuracy degrades exponentially with tool count
- Hierarchical tool organization (like toolsets) improves selection accuracy

**Paper Link**: [arxiv.org/abs/2405.17935](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17935)

**What This Means for You**: HyperTool's toolset approach aligns with best practices for tool organization in LLM systems.
