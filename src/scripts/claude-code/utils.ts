      "Discover all tools from connected MCP servers via HyperTool proxy",
    toolName: "list-all-tools",
    usage:
      "Use the list-all-tools tool from the HyperTool MCP server to see all discovered tools",
    parameters:
      "None required - this command shows all available tools from connected servers.",
    examples: `Use the list-all-tools tool to see all tools discovered from your configured MCP servers.

This will show you:
- Tool names (namespaced with server names)
- Descriptions of what each tool does
- Server sources
- Current availability status`,
    useCases: `- Before creating a new toolset, see what tools are available
- Troubleshooting tool discovery issues
- Understanding which servers are connected and working`,
    tips: `- Run this command after adding new MCP servers to your configuration
- Use the output to select tools for new toolsets
- Tools are namespaced (e.g., "git.status") to avoid conflicts`,
    relatedCommands: `- Use /new-toolset to create toolsets with discovered tools
- Use /equip-toolset to activate toolsets with these tools`,

      "Use the new-toolset tool from the HyperTool MCP server with toolset name and tool selections",
    parameters: `- toolsetName: Name for the new toolset (required)
- toolList: Array of tool names to include (use namespaced names from list-available-tools)
- description: Optional description for the toolset`,
    examples: `Use the new-toolset tool with parameters:
{
  "toolsetName": "development",
  "toolList": ["git.status", "git.commit", "docker.list_containers"],
  "description": "Essential development tools"
}

This will create a new toolset called "development" with the specified tools.`,
    useCases: `- Create project-specific toolsets for different workflows
- Group related tools together for easier management
- Build specialized toolsets for different team members or contexts`,
    tips: `- Use descriptive names for your toolsets
- Include only the tools you actually need to reduce complexity
- Run list-all-tools first to see what tools are available`,
    relatedCommands: `- Use /list-all-tools to see available tools before building
- Use /equip-toolset to activate your new toolset
- Use /list-toolsets to see all your created toolsets`,

      "Use the equip-toolset tool from the HyperTool MCP server with the name of the toolset to activate",
    parameters: `- toolsetName: Name of the toolset to activate (required)`,
    examples: `Use the equip-toolset tool with parameters:
{
  "toolsetName": "development"

This will activate the "development" toolset and make its tools available.`,
    useCases: `- Switch between different tool configurations for different projects
- Activate specialized toolsets for specific workflows
- Change context quickly without reconfiguring tools manually`,
    tips: `- Only one toolset can be active at a time
- Equipping a new toolset will replace the currently active one
- Use get-active-toolset to see what's currently equipped`,
    relatedCommands: `- Use /list-saved-toolsets to see available toolsets
- Use /get-active-toolset to see what's currently active
- Use /build-toolset to create new toolsets`,

    useCases: `- Review all available toolsets before choosing one to equip
- Manage and organize your toolset collection
- See toolset metadata and usage statistics`,
    tips: `- Use this command to get an overview of your toolset organization
- Look for toolsets with similar tools that could be consolidated
- Check creation dates to identify outdated toolsets`,
    relatedCommands: `- Use /equip-toolset to activate any of the listed toolsets
- Use /new-toolset to create new toolsets

      "None required - this command shows the currently active toolset.",
    examples: `Use the get-active-toolset tool to see detailed information about the currently active toolset:
- Toolset name and description
- Complete list of active tools
- Server sources for each tool
- Tool descriptions and capabilities`,
    useCases: `- Verify which toolset is currently active
- See detailed information about available tools in the active toolset
- Debug toolset configuration issues
- Understand tool capabilities and sources`,
    tips: `- Run this command if you're unsure what tools are available
- Use the output to understand tool namespacing and server sources
- Check this before using specific tools to verify they're available`,
