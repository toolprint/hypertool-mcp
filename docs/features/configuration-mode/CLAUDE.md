# Configuration Mode Feature - Agent Instructions

## Quick Start for Agents

You are implementing the **Configuration Mode** feature for hypertool-mcp. This feature separates configuration tools from operational tools to reduce cognitive load on AI assistants.

## Essential Reading Order

### 1. Understand the Project Context
1. **Read First**: `/CLAUDE.md` - Project development standards
2. **Read Second**: `/README.md` - Understand what hypertool-mcp does
3. **Read Third**: `./PRD.md` - Complete feature specification

### 2. Understand Current Architecture
Before implementing any task, familiarize yourself with:

#### Key Files to Study
```bash
# Core server implementation
src/server/enhanced.ts           # Main server class - you'll modify this
src/server/tools/index.ts       # Current tool registration
src/toolset/manager.ts          # ToolsetManager - your parallel component

# Tool implementations (for reference)
src/server/tools/equip-toolset.ts
src/server/tools/build-toolset.ts
src/server/tools/list-available-tools.ts

# Type definitions
src/server/tools/types.ts       # ToolModule interface
src/types/options.ts            # RuntimeOptions interface
```

#### Key Patterns to Understand
1. **Tool Module Pattern**: How tools are defined and registered
2. **Dependency Injection**: How tools receive dependencies
3. **Event System**: How `tools_changed` notifications work
4. **MCP Protocol**: Tool listing and calling conventions

## Task Implementation Guide

### Before Starting Any Task

1. **Check Dependencies**: Review the task's dependencies in `tasks/README.md`
2. **Read Previous Work**: If dependencies exist, understand their implementation
3. **Review Tests**: Look at existing test patterns in the codebase

### For Each Task

#### TASK-001: ConfigToolsManager
**Start Here** - This is the foundation
1. Study `src/toolset/manager.ts` for the pattern to follow
2. Look at how tool modules are structured in `src/server/tools/`
3. Create parallel structure in `src/config-tools/`

#### TASK-002: Mode Switching Tools
1. Reference existing tool implementations in `src/server/tools/`
2. Follow the same module pattern and Zod schema approach
3. These are simple tools with no arguments

#### TASK-003: Server Integration
**Most Complex Task** - Requires careful modification
1. Study entire `src/server/enhanced.ts` file first
2. Understand the current `listTools()` and `callTool()` flow
3. Add mode logic without breaking existing functionality

#### TASK-004: Auto-Exit Triggers
1. Modify existing tool handlers carefully
2. Ensure backward compatibility
3. Only trigger on successful operations

#### TASK-005: Feature Flag
1. Check how other runtime options are handled
2. Ensure flag properly disables all new behavior
3. Default should be new behavior (enabled)

#### TASK-006: Testing
1. Follow existing test patterns in the codebase
2. Mock dependencies appropriately
3. Test both success and failure paths

#### TASK-007: Documentation
1. Match the style of existing documentation
2. Include practical examples
3. Explain both the "what" and "why"

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### ❌ Don't Break Existing Functionality
- Always ensure backward compatibility
- Test with existing toolsets
- Verify `tools_changed` notifications still work

### ❌ Don't Forget Edge Cases
- What if no MCP servers are connected?
- What if toolset operations fail?
- What if mode switching is called in wrong mode?

### ❌ Don't Skip Tests
- Write tests as you implement
- Test error conditions
- Test with feature flag both on and off

## Implementation Checklist

Before marking any task complete:

- [ ] Code follows TypeScript best practices
- [ ] All tests pass (`npm test`)
- [ ] Linting passes (`npm run lint`)
- [ ] Feature works with flag enabled AND disabled
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing functionality
- [ ] Code is documented with JSDoc comments
- [ ] Integration tested with real MCP client

## Testing Your Implementation

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Run with configuration mode (default)
npm start -- --mcp-config .mcp.json

# Run with configuration mode disabled
npm start -- --mcp-config .mcp.json --disable-configuration-mode

# Test with stdio transport
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"tools/list","id":1}' | npm start
```

### Automated Testing
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test file
npm test -- src/config-tools/manager.test.ts

# Run with coverage
npm test -- --coverage
```

## Getting Help

### Key Concepts
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: The protocol for tool communication
- **Tool Module**: Self-contained tool definition with schema and handler
- **Toolset**: A saved configuration of selected tools
- **Discovery Engine**: Finds tools from downstream MCP servers

### Reference Implementation
The closest reference is the ToolsetManager. Your ConfigToolsManager should follow a similar pattern but for configuration tools instead of discovered tools.

### Architecture Decision
The separation of concerns is key:
- **ToolsetManager**: Manages discovered tools from downstream servers
- **ConfigToolsManager**: Manages built-in configuration tools
- **EnhancedMCPServer**: Routes between them based on mode

## Success Criteria

Your implementation is successful when:
1. Server starts in config mode when no toolset is equipped
2. Mode switching works smoothly via tool calls
3. Auto-exit triggers work on toolset equip
4. Feature flag properly disables the feature
5. All existing tests still pass
6. New tests provide >80% coverage

Remember: The goal is to reduce cognitive load on AI assistants by showing only relevant tools at the right time.
